            REFUNDS are NOT permitted for members who have paid in full and then wish to take a discounted offer or promotion instead. You may NOT cancel your membership to buy a cheaper deal, as your IP address is recorded and we reserve the right to ban your account on this basis.

A refund can NOT be given in part or whole for any subscription used or not used by any member for whatever reason. Users who wish to cancel their subscriptions are not permitted to seek a partial or full refund for any reason. If you do not wish to be billed again after your initial purchase, you must CANCEL your membership prior to the scheduled re-bill date. If your membership is not canceled before then, we reserve the right NOT to refund you on payments made to us due to your mistake.
